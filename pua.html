<h1>How to be a pick up artist</h1>
<P>　　In this era where beautiful women are everywhere on the internet, buddy, why are you still single?</P>
<P>　　Have you ever experienced this:</P>
<P>　　When you're lonely at midnight, you can only open your computer to watch Japanese AV,</P>
<P>　　Then take matters into your own hands...</P>
<P>　　Every night, friends walk hand in hand with their girlfriends, being romantic together</P>
<P>　　While you're miserably staying alone in your single dorm room playing games</P>
<P>　　Ask yourself: Which man doesn't long for a soulmate?</P>
<P>　　Which man doesn't yearn for tender embraces and passionate nights?</P>
<P>　　Which man doesn't desire a gentle, virtuous, and understanding wife to provide a warm harbor of love?</P>
<P>　　But reality is so unfair - some people have wives, mistresses, and lovers, while others approach their thirties still all alone.</P>
<P>　　The reasons for being single can be summarized into three categories.</P>
<P>　　Some say: It's because I'm not handsome enough. Well, look around you, aren't there guys uglier than you who still get beautiful women?</P>
<P>　　Some say: It's because I don't have money. If I had money and status, I'd have plenty of beautiful women. Well, look around you, aren't there guys in worse conditions than you who never lack girlfriends?</P>
<P>　　Some say: It's not that women don't like me, but the women who like me are unattractive, and I can't get the beautiful ones. Well, look around you, aren't there guys with lower education and income than you who still manage to date beautiful women?</P>
<P>　　We can't compare ourselves to the rich and handsome, so let's talk about ordinary guys. Tell me: Have you ever seen a street thug who lacks girlfriends? Some guys can't even afford to eat, but they still have beautiful girlfriends, and sometimes women even support them.</P>
<P>　　So the first fact I want to reveal is: Some people indeed have a natural talent for dating.</P>
<P>　　Generally speaking, men who are extroverted and sociable not only tend to succeed in their careers but also in love. Just look at any friend gathering - men who are witty and humorous quickly become the center of attention, with beautiful women gravitating toward them.</P>
<P>　　I used to be a multiple-time failure in love. I used to blame it on women being vain, materialistic, and superficial. Why do women prefer bad boys? Does being a good man mean no one will love you?</P>
<P>　　It wasn't until after I lived with multiple women through online dating that I finally realized: I had been making a mistake that most men make, and perhaps you're still making it now, which is:</P>
<P>　　"Pursuing women,"</P>
<P>　　"Believing that loving a woman means being 100% good to her."</P>
<P>　　In fact, the more you make women the center of your world,</P>
<P>　　The harder it is to get beautiful women's love!</P>
<P>　　Brother, are you interested in understanding why? If so, let me share my experience:</P>
<P>　　Unfortunately, I'm an introverted man who's not good at socializing and can't even speak standard Mandarin well. I don't smoke, don't drink, don't play cards, can't sing, can't dance... Apart from reading, I have no other hobbies. I work in Foshan, thousands of miles from home, with no house or car, and I'm small in stature. In short, no other guy could be in a worse situation than me, right?</P>
<P>　　I'm from a rural village in Hubei, and since I was twenty, I've experienced over thirty relationships in more than ten years, including blind dates and active pursuits, all ending in failure.</P>
<P>　　The two most painful failures: At twenty-eight, through a blind date, I finally found an ordinary-looking girl willing to marry me. My family went into huge debt for the wedding, and I had to bring her to work in Foshan, Guangdong. However, after just half a year in Foshan, she ran away with a street thug from another town.</P>
<P>　　Two years later, just as I was recovering from my failed marriage, since I was an only son, a distant relative introduced me to a divorced single woman. After dating and getting engaged, she came with me to Foshan. After just two nights of living together, I woke up on the third morning to find she had run away with the new clothes and phone I bought her, along with my 5,000 yuan savings.</P>
<P>　　I hated myself for being stupid, for being foolish, for being weak - why could I never keep my women?</P>
<P>　　After suffering these two heavy blows of failure, I began to despair about love. From then on, I stopped going on blind dates and stopped pursuing women.</P>
<P>　　In 2006, by chance, I learned to chat on QQ and became addicted to it. Although I no longer believed in love, as a normal man, I still yearned for women deep down. So, I desperately added strange young women online. Whenever I had free time, I would get on QQ to chat with women.</P>
<P>　　Like Columbus discovering the New World, I discovered my own new realm. Chatting with women on QQ, I no longer blushed, got nervous, or had shaky hands, because behind the computer, I had enough time to think about every word. Even though I was usually serious in person, I could occasionally come up with witty remarks.</P>
<P>　　After about a year of random chatting, I had several women on QQ who I could talk to quite well. One girl with the username "Wind Lily" chatted with me the longest, and she began to tell me about her life's hardships, and we became online confidants. Later, our chats became more intimate and harder to part from.</P>
<P>　　At that time, I was living in a small town in the Nanhai district of Foshan, so I invited Wind Lily to meet me where I lived. Because we had video chatted and talked on the phone before meeting, although I was a bit nervous when we met, I definitely didn't experience the awkward speechlessness of previous blind dates.</P>
<P>　　In the following dates, holding hands, hugging, and even going to bed all happened naturally. After living together for two months, due to some personality incompatibilities, I actively proposed breaking up. But this successful online relationship gave me great confidence because from beginning to end, I never begged for her love, yet love miraculously arrived.</P>
<P>　　This successful online dating experience made me discover an amazing secret hidden in QQ chatting:</P>
<P>　　The Power of Words Can Make Beautiful Women Fall in Love with You Automatically!!!</P>
<P>　　Of course, I also doubted if I was just lucky in love, maybe it was just a coincidence. So, I wanted to test if I could use the same method to make a second woman fall in love with me online.</P>
<P>　　Buddy, guess what?</P>
<P>　　The second successful online relationship took about 8 months.</P>
<P>　　The third successful online relationship took about 6 months.</P>
<P>　　In the 7 years after that, I changed girlfriends every three months on average, and each successful online relationship cost me less than 2000 yuan (excluding abortion expenses, of course).</P>
<P>　　Friends who have dated know that from meeting a girl (referring to decent women) to having her accept your love and agree to live together, you have to go through countless dates and gift-giving, with incalculable expenses. Moreover, dating is a typical high-risk game with huge investments but no guaranteed returns.</P>
<P>　　Why can't many men find wives, not just average guys, but even some who could be considered tall, rich, and handsome? It's because we men easily fall into traditional thinking traps:</P>
<P>　　First major misconception: Pursuing women! As long as you understand dating as pursuing women, your path to love will be full of twists and bitterness.</P>
<P>　　Any woman, as long as she's not too ugly, will have numerous pursuers, and you're just one of them. What competitive advantage do you have? Treating meals, sending flowers, giving gifts, picking up and dropping off at work? Others can do the same things. You spend every day racking your brains thinking about how to please her, the torment of dating exceeds its joy. Even if you persist until marriage, you definitely won't act like a pushover after marriage as you did before, and women will definitely feel a huge psychological letdown, leading to conflicts.</P>
<P>　　Looking back at my more than thirty failed relationships, it was because I fell into the trap of pursuing women. Desperately pursuing someone is unlikely to succeed because you're always in the position of being chosen.</P>
<P>　　Second major misconception: Loving a woman means being 100% good to her.</P>
<P>　　There's a truth: how you want others to treat you is how you should treat others. We often use friendship principles to handle romantic relationships. When a man truly falls in love with a woman, he usually thinks that if he's 100% good to her and dedicates himself to her, she will definitely be good to him too. Little does he know this is thinking about love from a man's rational perspective.</P>
<P>　　Think from a woman's perspective. When a man treats a beautiful woman to dinner, what does she subconsciously think? Nothing more than "he wants to hook up with me, wants to sleep with me, I won't fall for his tricks."</P>
<P>　　Women are such sensitive creatures,</P>
<P>　　When you give to women, women subconsciously think you</P>
<P>　　must be expecting something bigger in return. So beautiful women comfortably enjoy</P>
<P>　　men's various contributions while internally</P>
<P>　　always guarding against men getting too close.</P>
<P>　　Whether in life or TV dramas, in most cases: the more a man gives to a woman, the less she cares about you. If a man loves a woman to the point of losing his self-respect, he will eventually lose that woman.</P>
<P>　　Buddy, do you know why?</P>
<P>　　If you don't understand women's psychology, you'll only curse women as being shallow and materialistic like I used to.</P>
<P>　　Actually, what women desire</P>
<P>　　in love isn't how good a man is to them,</P>
<P>　　but whether this man can bring them happiness,</P>
<P>　　security, trust, and support -</P>
<P>　　these feelings of well-being.</P>
<P>　　If you can understand this point, you'll understand why a woman you've pampered ends up with another man who treats her indifferently, even when that man's conditions are inferior to yours in many ways.</P>
<P>　　Buddy, understand this: love is a game between the sexes. Either she attracts you, or you attract her. But who plays the leading role completely changes the process and outcome.</P>
<P>　　Therefore, to make women actively love you, a core premise is that you must be the protagonist of love. You must enlighten yourself: stop seeing love as so sacred, stop seeing women as so unattainable, women actually desire the opposite sex just like we men do.</P>
<P>　　Love is just a game between the sexes!</P>
<P>　　When you truly understand this point, you'll realize that to be the protagonist in the love game, the most important thing is to cultivate your own magnetism, not deliberately trying to please the other person. This is the way of love, and communication through language or text is just technique.</P>
<P>　　Buddy,</P>
<P>　　reading this far,</P>
<P>　　do you understand the main reason you're single?</P>
<P>　　It's not because you're not handsome or rich, it's because you don't</P>
<P>　　understand women's hearts!</P>
<P>　　Last year around this time, a rather dramatic event occurred. One day, I suddenly received an advertisement in my QQ email selling pickup artist materials. Out of curiosity, I bought an expensive set.</P>
<P>　　The pickup materials were well-explained, but the premise of picking up girls was to transform yourself into a master of approaching and verbal communication. So, I tried to approach women following the instructions, but found that despite my experience with numerous women, I was still not good at communicating with strange women. Even when I got their phone numbers, several dates ended in failure, and this traditional dating method was very costly.</P>
<P>　　Therefore, here's the second fact to reveal: People should never try to compensate for their personality shortcomings, changing personality is harder than climbing to heaven!</P>
<P>　　A person who isn't good at conversation will get different results telling the same joke compared to someone with a good sense of humor. It's like sales - some people can sell products over the phone, while others can't make a sale even face-to-face.</P>
<P>　　So, if verbal communication isn't our strength, can't we find love in a different way?</P>
<P>　　Brother, think about it - what's the biggest advantage of introverted people like us? Isn't it being steady, detail-oriented, and emotionally rich? Why can't we play to our strengths and communicate through text? If they can attract girls with their verbal skills, why can't we do it with our writing skills?</P>
<P>　　And let me tell you a secret:</P>
<P>　　Written words Have more tension than spoken words, More imagination, more depth, Text can better touch A beautiful woman's soul.</P>
<P>　　Maybe you'll say, "Brother, no matter how wonderfully you describe the power of words, I don't have that literary talent! I've been chatting on QQ for years, and no beautiful woman has fallen for me!"</P>
<P>　　No! No! No! You've misunderstood the meaning of textual charm. I'm not saying you need to be well-read or eloquent - otherwise, there wouldn't be so many highly educated single men. The charm of written language I'm talking about is understanding women's psychology.</P>
<P>　　Men are rational beings, women are emotional beings - this is the fundamental difference in how they view love.</P>
<P>　　Few women like you because you're always trying to please them using a man's way of thinking, which often backfires. To write charming messages, you first need to change your thinking pattern.</P>
<P>　　When communicating with women, always start from an emotional perspective.</P>
<P>　　Every woman is an emotional being. Once you find her emotional triggers, every time you touch those triggers with your words, she'll move one step closer to you.</P>
<P>　　While verbal ability might be innate - like Li Yunlong in "Drawing Sword," who's rough but skilled at communication - writing ability comes from practice and becomes natural with time.</P>
<P>　　The Bible says when God closes one door, He opens a window. So introverted homebodies shouldn't underestimate themselves - being detail-oriented and comfortable spending long hours at the computer is actually our strength.</P>
<P>　　So, homebody brothers, if you lack verbal charm, you must develop your written communication charm!</P>
<P>　　Once you master the secrets of textual charm, you can make beautiful women fall for you through QQ chat.</P>
<P>　　My 8 years of online dating experience might be hard for you to accept, because first, I need to revolutionize your thinking:</P>
<P>　　One prerequisite: You must find an easy, relaxed way to date and enjoy the process.</P>
<P>　　Three iron rules:</P>
<P>　　Don't pursue women; attract them with your personal charm.</P>
<P>　　The secret to attracting women is having deeper thoughts and insights than them, making them your fans. Women naturally admire strength - don't try to change women, but discover where you're stronger than them.</P>
<P>　　Don't try to convince women with logic; guide them with emotions!</P>
<P>　　You need to repeatedly consider these experiences. Once you understand them, you'll have enough confidence that QQ chat is the shortcut to love, especially suitable for introverted internet homebodies.</P>
<P>　　Of course, brothers who have limited experience with women might not get it right away. No worries - as long as you take action and practice communicating with women, you'll naturally understand with experience.</P>
<P>　　You might think I'm bragging or making up stories, but brothers who have dating experience will surely relate to my feelings.</P>
<P>　　Women may seem mysterious, But once you understand their common traits, It's like fishing - if you use the right bait, You can catch any fish!</P>
<P>　　Here I'll reveal a core secret - keep it confidential, don't let your QQ female friends know, or it won't work anymore.</P>
<P>　　There are only two key points in QQ dating:</P>
<P>　　First key point: Become the woman's confidant. Once you enter her inner world, she'll easily fall for you through dependency.</P>
<P>　　Second key point: When meeting in person, find a way to hold hands. Once there's physical contact, getting intimate is natural.</P>
<P>　　The crucial principle of successful QQ dating: You must first enter a woman's heart before entering her body.</P>
<P>　　If traditional pursuit of women is like lion hunting - with prey running desperately ahead and lions chasing exhaustively behind, with low success rates - then my method is like a hunter's approach: setting up traps first, then using appropriate bait to gradually lead the prey into our prepared setup.</P>
<P>　　QQ text chat for me Is like a dating slide, using Words to entice women down step by step, Until they slide into my arms!</P>
<P>　　Over these 8 years, I've successfully made dozens of women my close female friends. Among them, 18 lived with me for over 2 months, and the last one is now my wife. I can't reveal their identities for privacy reasons. I'm ready to settle down now and don't want to be an online playboy anymore.</P>
<P>　　Everyone can chat on QQ, and the internet is full of beautiful women, so why are there still so many single men? Clearly, even simple things have their tricks.</P>
<P>　　If you follow my method and spend 2 hours chatting with beautiful women daily, after one month (60 hours), I guarantee you'll win a beauty's heart. Of course, there are secrets to each step - unless you're willing to take me as your mentor. Otherwise, how come you've been chatting on QQ for so long without any women falling for you?</P>
<P>　　I've promised my wife to stop online dating, but it's a shame these 8 years of valuable online dating experience might go to waste. Brother, do you need my help?</P>
<P>　　Special reminder: If you find a girlfriend using my method, don't forget to invite me to your wedding!</P>
<P>　　Whether I'm bragging or really have something valuable to share, you'll know once you contact me. Contact email: <strong>jasonwang8421@gmail.com</strong></P>
